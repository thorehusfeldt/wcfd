**Will Code For Drinks** is a social event hosted by ScrollBar at IT University of Copenhagen. Teams of up to three people collaborate to solve fun programming problems in return for free beverages at the bar.

With 50 teams participating, **Will Code For Drinks** is one of the largest programming events in Scandinavia. Unlike many similar events, **Will Code For Drinks** is not a competition.
The problems are constructed to be attractive for newcomers, the atmosphere is extremely relaxed, and participants are encouraged to help each other with debugging, problem solving, or basic programming language or computer issues. We  are available and eager to help at all times during the event. There are no prizes to win, and no awards ceremony; the focus is on problem solving, social interaction, programming, and fun.

The event should be entertaining and meaningful for everybody, no matter your skill level: Even if you have zero confidence in your own programming ability, we promise that you’ll get at least one problem done. On the other hand, even if you’re a very experienced programmer, the harder problems should be enough to keep you busy. Don’t expect to solve all problems.

Who is this for?
----------------

The ideal participants are first-year students with a few months of introductory programming under their belt. Students from outside ITU are *extremely welcome*, as are non-students, and even professors.

Details

Here’s how to have the most fun:

* Bring your own laptop, which must be able to connect to the ITU wireless network, for instance via eduroam.
* One laptop per team
* Up to three people per team, three is best
* The event lasts 3 hours and contains half a dozen problems. 
* One free beverage per solved problem per person, up to a maximum of 3 beverages.
* Some 20 different programming languages are accepted, including Java, Python, and various C dialects. See the Kattis documentationn for the full list.
* Teams must register before the event (anonymous participation is fine)
* After solving a problem (and having it accepted on the server), immediately walk up to the bar and tell the bartender which team you are on.
* The event is hosted on the Kattis platform. If you want to prepare, you can try to solve some problem on Open Kattis. This is particularly useful for learning how to read and write input and output. Otherwise we’ll help during the event.
