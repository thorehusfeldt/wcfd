**Will Code For Drinks** is a social event originating at [ScrollBar](https://scrollbar.dk) at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk).
Teams of friends collaborate to solve entertaining programming problems in return for free beverages at the bar.

Friday, 15 November 2024 16:15–19:00 (CET)
------------------------------------------

With more than 150 teams participating, **Will Code For Drinks** is one of the largest programming events in Scandinavia.
The problems are constructed to be attractive for newcomers, the atmosphere is extremely relaxed, and participants are encouraged to help each other with problem solving, debugging, or basic programming language or computer issues.
Assistants are available and eager to help at all times during the event.
The focus is on problem solving, social interaction within and among teams, programming, confidence-building and fun.

Although **Will Code For Drinks** is not a coding competition and there’s no prizes to win for programming skills, we do have a special challenge for you. Show off your creativity and style, and get ready to flaunt your unique team spirit and coding fashion. The number one best-dressed team will be awarded a prize by the end of the event.

Who is this for?
----------------

The event should be entertaining and meaningful for programmers at every skill level: 
Even if you have zero confidence in your own programming ability, we promise that you’ll get at least one problem done.
On the other hand, the harder problems should be enough to keep experienced programmers busy.
Don’t expect to solve all problems; aim at two or three.

The target participants are first-year students with a few months of introductory programming under their belt, and who have never participated in something like this.
Some of the problems are easy enough even for Computer Science professors!

Next event
----------

**Will Code For Drinks 2024** is scheduled for 15 November 2024, 16:15–19:00 Danish time (CET).

Known hosts:

* [ScrollBar](https://scrollbar.dk), IT University of Copenhagen, [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk), Denmark.
*  [Fredagscaféen](https://fredagscafeen.dk) at [Institut for Datalogi, Aarhus Universitet](https://cs.au.dk). [[Facebook event](https://fb.me/e/2auPrEEtr)].
* Studentercaféen Hegnet, [DTU](https://dtu.dk), Technical University of Denmark, Kgs.Lyngby. Sponsorered by JobIndex and Netcompany; [[Facebook event](https://facebook.com/events/s/will-code-for-drinks-hegnet-x-/541662995144981/)].
* [Bragginn in Nauthólsvík](https://bragginnbar.is), Reykjavík, Iceland; sponsored by [Tern Systems](https://www.tern.systems)
* Bergen, Norway (details to be announced.)

* **Call for problems.** If you want to join problem development, email thore@itu.dk, preferably with a suggestion or two for a problem. Problem development happens in a shared Github repository and uses [BAPCtools](https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/BAPCtools), communication is via Slack. We expect to spend considerable time during September and October 2024.

* **Call for hosts.** If you want to _host_ a WCFD event in 2024, also email thore@itu.dk. Hosting involves very little; but you _must_ provide a setup for a _physical_ event that is consistent in atmosphere with WCFD. In particular, it shouldn't feel like a competition, and the host should hand out free beverages for solved problems.

(No) Preparation
----------------

No formal preparation is required, you can show up at the last minute.
However:

* It’s more fun if you find some friends to team up with.
* One of you should bring a computer for programming, and you’ll need pen and paper for problem solving and collaborative thinking. Bring a charger or make sure your batteries are full.
* If you’ve never done something like this before and want to get a feeling for the type of problems appearing at the event, you can try to solve some easy problems on Open Kattis, such as [Hello World!](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello), [Baby Bites](https://open.kattis.com/problems/babybites), or maybe even the WCFD 2019 problem [Drinking Song](https://open.kattis.com/problems/drinkingsong).
This is particularly useful for learning how to read and write input and output. But don’t stress out over this beforehand – we’ll help during the event.
You can find more of the older problems publicly at [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/search?q=will+code+for+drinks)

Details
-------

Here’s how to have the most fun:

* Bring your own (fully charged) laptop, which must be able to connect to the wireless network, for instance via eduroam. We won't have facilities for plugging in extenders, so charging options will be *very limited*.
* One laptop per team.
* Up to three people per team, three is best.
* The event lasts for three hours and contains half a dozen problems. 
* One free beverage per solved problem per person, up to a maximum of three beverages per person.
* Some twenty different programming languages are accepted, including Java, Python, JavaScript, and various C dialects. 
  See the [Kattis language overview](https://open.kattis.com/languages) for the full list.
* No prior registration is required. When the server is up, you can create your team at [wcfd24.kattis.com](https://wcfd24.kattis.com) on the day of the event (or as soon as the server becomes online, which may be a few days earlier), including after the event has started. Help with this is available from 15:45 in ScrollBar. Anonymous participation is fine; creative team names are appreciated.
* After your team solves a problem (and having it accepted on the server), you will get a drinks tickets for the bar.
